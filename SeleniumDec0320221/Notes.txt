Consider this as a starting point for a larger project. It has the essential components (of course, not all) for an UI automation project. Extend it as needed. Examples:

Run in firefox/edge instead of chrome? - update the config.properties.
Add more pages/tests? - just create the classes.
Add more tests? - create more @Test methods in your test classes.
Run multi tests/run tests in parallel? - configure in testng.xml
Want more control over test runs? - configure testng.xml and/or pom.xml.
Run via maven? - use maven commands from CLI
Run via jenkins? - create a jenkins job, trigger via maven commands/auto-trigger based on GIT commits, its all possible.
Want logs in a separate file for each run? - configure in log4j2.xml.
