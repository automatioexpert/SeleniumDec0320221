Since Firefox version 48, Mozilla requires all add-ons to be signed. Until
recently, Firefox support in Selenium was exclusively provided by an add-on.
As this add-on is not currently signed, this solution does not work with the
latest Firefox releases. As an alternative, Mozilla are working on a WebDriver
specification compliant implementation named GeckoDriver. Please note that the specification is not complete, and that Selenium itself does not comply with
the specification at this time. This means that features previously available
through Selenium will not be available using GeckoDriver.

Any issue logged here for Firefox 48 or later will be closed as a duplicate of
#2559. Our recommendation is to switch to GeckoDriver, or to continue testing
on Firefox 45 until GeckoDriver is a viable option for you. If you are
interested in helping us to sign the add-on to restore support for later
Firefox versions, please see the following comment for what's needed:
