# UITesting for the given link 
https://rahulshettyacademy.com/locatorspractice/
Mainly Java - Selenium code will be used as I am a newcomer to this domain.
we login to the given link and automate the process:
1. Use my name as username and wrongpassword as password and then we click on the forgot password button and get the temp password.
2. We then use the temp password to login and check whether the 'successfully logged in' text is displayed or not.
3. Then we log out and close the instance of the edge browser.
