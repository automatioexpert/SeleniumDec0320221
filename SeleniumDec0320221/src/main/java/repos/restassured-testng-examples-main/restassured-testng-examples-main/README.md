## REST Assured Examples | Anh Tester

### Hello Everyone !!
This project is the outcome of my self-learning of the API Testing Automation Framework using REST Assured. I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the API tests in an efficient way. Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository.


### What does this repository contain?
- Example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.
- Hamcrest Matchers are used for assertions.
- TestNG Listeners are used to capture the events in logs.
- Log4j is used to capture logs.
- Extent Report
- Lombok has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
- Rest APIs on https://reqres.in/ has been used for testing.

### Other features
- I have covered, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.
- Sample code to handle the `authentication` requests have also been added.

### Run Test
- Using command: `mvn clean test`
