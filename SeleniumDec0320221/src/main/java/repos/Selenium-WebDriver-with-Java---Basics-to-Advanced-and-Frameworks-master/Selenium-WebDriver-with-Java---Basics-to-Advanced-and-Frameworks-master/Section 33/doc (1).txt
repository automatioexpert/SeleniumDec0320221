TestCases Specifications in Behaviour Driven Development :

Step 1:

Testcases should be defined in a Business level by following a ubiquitous language

Ubiquitous language is a (semi-)formal language that is shared by all members of a software development team — both software developers and non-technical personnel.[15]

Syntax :

In order to(Achieve something)-> Business outcome

As a (Role)

I want to Do this

Example:

In order to Pay Credit Card Payment

As a NetBanking sole owner who have credit section access

I want to Navigate to credit card section, Enter amount and process my Payment

Step 2:

Its time to Decide what Test cases are sufficient to certify Business Scenario working

Syntax for Writing Testcases:

Given (what you need to have to perform action), -Prerequists

When (performs action)- Action

Then (the desired outcome for the user).- Validation

Example:

Given : An account with zero balance

When: I navigate to Credit card Payment Section and click on submit bu giving amount

Then : It should throw error message –fund

Given : An account with sufficent balance who does not have credit card

When: I navigate to Credit card Payment Section

Then :You don't have to access as your are error message

Given : An account with sufficent balance who does not have credit card

When: I navigate to Credit card Payment Section and amount

Then :You don't have to access /error message

Advantages:

This can be used as Standard Template where all QA can stick to one common standards of defining Testcases

Each Scenario reflects a Business Value

We can estimate the Test coverage happened for Each Business outcome by going through Test Cases

We can tag these Annotations to Selenium Automation and execute the Business Testcases

Common Standardised Testcase template for both Manual and Automation testing
