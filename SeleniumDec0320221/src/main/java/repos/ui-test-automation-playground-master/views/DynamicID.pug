                p Modern applications often generate dynamic IDs for elements. In this case ID is not a reliable attribute for using in element selector. By default many UI automation tools record IDs and this results in tests broken from the very beginning. An automation tool needs a way to instruct it to skip dynamic IDs when XPath is generated for an element.

                    li Record button click.
                    li Then execute your test to make sure that ID is not used for button identification.
