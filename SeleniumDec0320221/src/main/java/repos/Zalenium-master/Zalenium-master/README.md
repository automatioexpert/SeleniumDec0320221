We are auto scaling Selenium Grid with Runtime Container- Zalenium. This is capable of creating node containers at run time and destroy once execution is over. Zalenium works with Kubernetes, to get auto-scaling and auto-healing capabilities. Zalenium will keep on registerting new node whenever needed. We need not to manually run the image and then link it. We also need not to have any fix number of containers. So, basically Zalenium will do everything for us. It will keep our test environment quite scalable.
