### [ABOUT CHARITY](https://code.org/)

Code.org¬Æ is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools and increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. Their vision is that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. The leading provider of K-12 computer science curriculum in the largest school districts in the United States, Code.org also created the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged more than 15% of all students in the world.

**Working together, we can reduce the digital divide!**

With the Testing for Good event, we're helping to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science ‚Äî online and in schools where Code.org  will establish permanent courses and train teachers. For every dollar you donate, one child will be introduced to computer science.

To make your donations go even further, Sauce Labs will match up to $2,500.

### ‚úÖüëèEnvironment setup is complete if tests passed

> If you weren't successful at setting up you local env, then use the [Gitpod approach](#gitpod-setup)üëá

### Add static code analysis

:information_source: Optional Bonus

* Follow [Codacy instructions to setup static code analysis for your first repo](https://docs.codacy.com/getting-started/codacy-quickstart/)
* Adding and analyzing takes a bit
* [Configure code patterns for the repo](https://docs.codacy.com/repositories-configure/configuring-code-patterns/#pattern-filters)

### Gitpod setup

[üíªJoin Slack #help-desk for tech support](https://join.slack.com/t/testingforgood/shared_invite/zt-zc64x3pc-9ebUXVeXW1fB0JxU1R_9ew)


:information_source:&nbsp; Gitpod lets you run an entire Dev environment from a browser! You can use this approach if you don't know how to setup a local Java environment.

1. Sign up for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this repository
    * Make sure you are logged into GitHub
    * Click the fork in the upper right of GitHub
    * Select your username as the location to fork the repo
3. In the browser address bar, prepend the GitHub url (`https://github.com/USERNAME/automation-best-practices-java`) with `https://gitpod.io/#`
    * The resulting url should look as follows:
   
      > https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/USERNAME/automation-best-practices-java
   
4. Once the Gitpod.io URL is loaded, you will need to sign in with the GitHub account you created earlier 
5. Once the development environment is loaded, you should see 'Ready to test!' in the Terminal window in the lower portion of the window, run the following commands in that Terminal to set your `SAUCE_USERNAME`, `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`, and `SCREENER_API_KEY`:

:information_source:&nbsp; You can get your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

:information_source:&nbsp; You can get your Screener API Key by going to the [API key](https://screener.io/v2/account/api-key) page in your Screener settings

```bash
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_USERNAME=<sauce_username>)
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<sauce_access_key>)
eval $(gp env -e SCREENER_API_KEY=<screener_api_key>)
```

> Replace <sauce_username>, <sauce_access_key>, and <screener_api_key> with your credentials

Once you have run those 3 commands, you can run the following commands to test your environment variables:

```bash
echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
echo $SCREENER_API_KEY
```

Run sanity tests

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=SanityTest -X
```
