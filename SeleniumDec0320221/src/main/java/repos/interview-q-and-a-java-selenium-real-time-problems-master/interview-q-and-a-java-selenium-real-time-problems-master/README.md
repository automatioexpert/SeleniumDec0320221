### List of Programs and their solutions which are being asked in  Real Time Automation Testing interviews.

### 1.Problem: Find Factorial of the Number using Recursion technique

> [Click Here for Solution](src/main/java/com/automationfraternity/_1_Factorial_Recursive.java)

---

### 2.Problem: Write a code which takes any String and prints all the words and their corresponding count

> [Click Here for Solution](src/main/java/com/automationfraternity/_2_Count_All_Words_In_String.java)

---

### 3.Problem: Remove All numbers from the String

* Use Link to know more on Regular Expression: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp

### 4. Cucumber tags And, Or, Not Operations.
    
* Tags can be sent from maven command line using: ```mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@sanity and @regression"```
* Also can be sent from cucumber options: ```@CucumberOptions(tags = "@smoke and @fast")```
  
* ```tags="@Sanity"``` :  Will Run Scenario which is tagged with Sanity. Does not matter if it has other tags as well.
* ```tags="@Sanity and @Regression"``` : Will Run Scenario which is tagged with Sanity as well as Regression.
* ```tags="@Sanity and not @Regression"``` :  Will Run Scenario which is tagged with Sanity but not Regression.
* ```tags="@Sanity or @Regression"``` : Will Run Scenario tagged with Sanity or Regression.

* Complex Case: I want to run @Sanity and @ui, but not @Regression
* ```tags="@Sanity and @ui"``` : Will Run Scenario tagged with @Sanity and @ui. But this also run test case which has @Sanity, @Ui but other tags as well.
* So, I should write: ```tags="@Sanity and @ui and (not @Regression)```

### 5. Print Patterns

* These are very common code questions people ask in the interviews.
* There is no other way then to practice them and they also help in logic building.
* Not putting in whole code here. Please check the code under ```src/main/java/com/automationfraternity/_5_Print_Patterns.java``` file.
* Usefull Link: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples/pyramid-pattern

### 6. Read the Text file and Count each Word

* Counting words is already covered in Problem # 2
* In this once I am rather focusing on Reading the text files:
* There are in-fact many ways a Text file can be read in java. (This actually makes things more confusing)
* Each way has different use cases.
* I am presenting few ways here. Which are very generic for fetching the text as a String for a simple and small text file.
* Usefull Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-reading-text-file-java/

### 16. Web Driver Listener
* Web Driver have a another implementation of Web Driver in the form of the class ```EventFiringWebDrvier```.
* This Class has all the features of a typical Web Driver but with inherent capability of logging for various web driver events.
* Please check the Impl for the same in these below two classes.
* To make selenium work, you need to add the chromedriver file in the root directory of this repo.
> This holds the Listener Class: [Click here for Solution](src/main/java/com/automationfraternity/_16_1_WebDriverEvenListenerImpl.java)
> This holds the sample Test: [Click here for Solution](src/main/java/com/automationfraternity/_16_Selenium_WebDriver_Listeners.java)
