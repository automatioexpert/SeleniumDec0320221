# Contributing Code to Selenium

Much of the magic behind Selenium is the hard work of programmers with backgrounds in Javascript, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, C#, HTML and other languages.

We encourage code patches and other contributions - get involved by following the instructions at the main [Selenium GitHub](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md). You can also track the activity of the development team by checking out the read-only [Selenium Developer Activity Group](http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developer-activity).

If you do supply a patch we will need you to [sign the CLA](https://goo.gl/a2VrTx). We are a part of [SFC](http://www.sfconservancy.org/).
